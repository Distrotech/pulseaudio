; This is a profile for Nvidia and Intel cards - some cards have four HDMI codecs,
; and which ones are working seems to vary a lot between GPU boards. In addition,
; Nvidia and Intel make southbridges as well, so we need to keep the existing
; analog profiles.
; (And by not adding all these extra profiles to default.conf, we make sure
; there is no performance hit for non-Nvidia/Intel cards.)
